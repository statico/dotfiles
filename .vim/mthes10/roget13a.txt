An electronic thesaurus derived from the version of Roget's Thesaurus
published in 1911.

     This core thesaurus is provided along with the unabridged Moby Thesaurus
main corpus to frame the traditional concept divisions that may be useful
if the licensee is considering converting the flat-file Moby Thesaurus to
the concept/index scheme.  Note that no index is herein provided -- it is
presumed that a subset of the 30,000 roots in Moby Thesaurus II will be used
to generate the user's custom index.

     Note that this version of Thesaurus-1911 has been supplemented with
over 1,000 words not present in the original 1911 edition, but many modern
words are still missing.  About 1500 verbs (out of 6500) which can be found
in an 80,000-word spell-checker are absent from this work.  The deficiency
of nouns is probably much worse, especially on technical topics.  Of 40,000
unique words contained in the original text, 12,000 are not recognized by a
spell-checker.  Most of these are foreign words(primarily Latin), and many
are obsolete.  In this version, these words are marked as such by comments
in square brackets.  Although this version has been proof-read, there are
doubtless numerous residual transcription errors, some of which may be
obvious even without reference to the original text.  We will be grateful
if any of these are brought to our attention; the corrections will appear
in subsequent versions.

     In this file, comments which are not a proper part of the thesaurus
itself are contained within arrow brackets thus: <-- comment -->.
     Section headings,  which are not an actual part of the thesaurus
proper, are included between percent (%) markers.
     Occasional references to numbers starting with "@" are the embryonic
beginnings of a reorganized version, mentioned below.  A few comments are
also included within curly brackets {}.
          ============================================

  The following additional differences will be noted between this version
and the original edition of the printed 1911 thesaurus:
  (1)  the space-saving abbreviations in the original, using hyphens to
represent common words, prefixes or suffixes, have been expanded into the
full words or phrases.
  (2) the side-by-side format for words and their opposites has been
abandoned.  Words are listed in order of their entry number.
  (3)  each main entry (1035 entries) has a pound sign "#" in front of the
number to facilitate computerized search.
  (4) greek words and phrases are transliterated and included between
brackets in the format <gr/greek word/gr>.
  (5)  where italics occurred in the original, italics are used in the
Microsoft Word format file.  In the plain ASCII file, this formatting is
lost.
  (6)  in the original book, words which were obsolete (in 1911) were
marked with a dagger.  In this version, those words are marked with a
vertical bar ("|").
     Some of the words which were still current in 1911, but are no longer
found in a current college-size dictionary (presently obsolete words), or
which are no longer used in the specific indicated sense, have been marked
with a bar followed by an exclamation point "|!".  However, this marking
process has just commenced, and only a small portion of the words which are
now obsolete have been thus marked.  Most though not all of the foreign-
language phrases are now obsolete.
     The "obsolete" notation [obs3] indicates that the previous word (or
some word in the previous phrase) is not recognized by the word processor's
spelling checker, and also is either NOT in a modern college-sized
dictionary, or is noted there as being "ARCHAIC".
  (7)  the approximate location of the bottom of each page in the original
1911 printed book is indicated by a comment of the form: <--  p.  23 -->.
To search for a page, note that there are two spaces between the "p." and
the page number.
  (8)  This file contains only the main body of the thesaurus.  Neither
outline nor index are contained here.
