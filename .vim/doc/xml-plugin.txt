*xml-plugin.txt*  Help edit XML and SGML documents.                   v1.29

				   XML Edit      ~

A filetype plugin to help edit XML and SGML documents.

This script provides some convenience when editing XML (and some SGML
including HTML) formated documents. It allows you to jump to the beginning
or end of the tag block your cursor is in. '%' will jump between '<' and '>'
within the tag your cursor is in. When in insert mode and you finish a tag
(pressing '>') the tag will be completed. If you press '>' twice it will
complete the tag and place the cursor in the middle of the tags on it's own
line (helps with nested tags).

Usage: Place this file into your ftplugin directory. To add html support
Sym-link or copy this file to html.vim in your ftplugin directory. To activte
the script place 'filetype plugin on' in your |.vimrc| file. See |ftplugins|
for more information on this topic.

If the file edited is of type "html" and "xml_use_html" is  defined then the
following tags will not auto complete:
<img>, <input>, <param>, <frame>, <br>, <hr>, <meta>, <link>, <base>, <area>

If the file edited is of type 'html' and 'xml_use_xhtml' is defined the above
tags will autocomplete the xml closing staying xhtml compatable.
ex. <hr> becomes <hr /> (see |xml-plugin-settings|)

NOTE: If you used the VIM 5.x version of this file (xmledit.vim) you'll need
to comment out the section where you called it. It is no longer used in the
VIM 6.x version. 

Known Bugs      ~

- This script will modify registers ". and "x; register "" will be restored.
- < & > marks inside of a CDATA section are interpreted as actual XML tags
  even if unmatched.
- Although the script can handle leading spaces such as < tag></ tag> it is
  illegal XML syntax and considered very bad form.
- Placing a literal `>' in an attribute value will auto complete dispite that
  the start tag isn't finished. This is poor XML anyway you should use
  &gt; instead.
- The matching algorithm can handle illegal tag characters where as the tag
  completion algorithm can not.

							 *xml-plugin-mappings*
Mappings      ~

<LocalLeader> is a setting in VIM that depicts a prefix for scripts and
plugins to use. By default this is the backslash key `\'. See |mapleader|
for details.

<LocalLeader>x
	Visual - Place a custom XML tag to suround the selected text. You
	need to have selected text in visual mode before you can use this
	mapping. See |visual-mode| for details.

<LocalLeader>.   or      <LocalLeader>>
        Insert - Place a literal '>' without parsing tag.

<LocalLeader>5   or      <LocalLeader>%
        Normal or Visual - Jump to the begining or end tag.

<LocalLeader>d
        Normal - Deletes the surrounding tags from the cursor. >
            <tag1>outter <tag2>inner text</tag2> text</tag1>
                    ^
<       Turns to: >
            outter <tag2>inner text</tag2> text
            ^

Options      ~

(All options must be placed in your |.vimrc| prior to the |ftplugin|
command.)

xml_tag_completion_map
	Use this setting to change the default mapping to auto complete a
	tag. By default typing a literal `>' will cause the tag your editing
	to auto complete; pressing twice will auto nest the tag. By using
	this setting the `>' will be a literal `>' and you must use the new
	mapping to perform auto completion and auto nesting. For example if
	you wanted Control-L to perform auto completion inmstead of typing a
	`>' place the following into your .vimrc: >
            let xml_tag_completion_map = "<C-l>"
<
xml_no_auto_nesting
	This turns off the auto nesting feature. After a completion is made
	and another `>' is typed xml-edit automatically will break the tag
	accross multiple lines and indent the curser to make creating nested
	tqags easier. This feature turns it off. Enter the following in your
	.vimrc: >
            let xml_no_auto_nesting = 1
<
xml_use_xhtml
	When editing HTML this will auto close the short tags to make valid
	XML like <hr /> and <br />. Enter the following in your vimrc to
	turn this option on: >
            let xml_use_xhtml = 1
<
xml_no_html
	This turns of the support for HTML specific tags. Place this in your
        .vimrc: >
            let xml_no_html = 1

							*xml-plugin-callbacks*
Callback Functions      ~

A callback function is a function used to customize features on a per tag
basis. For example say you wish to have a default set of attributs when you
type an empty tag like this:
    You type: <tag>
    You get:  <tag default="attributes"></tag>

This is for any script programmers who wish to add xml-plugin support to
there own filetype plugins.

Callback functions recive one attribute variable which is the tag name. The
all must return either a string or the number zero. If it returns a string
the plugin will place the string in the proper location. If it is a zero the
plugin will ignore and continue as if no callback existed.

The following are implemented callback functions:

HtmlAttribCallback
	This is used to add default attributes to html tag. It is intended
	for HTML files only.

XmlAttribCallback
	This is a generic callback for xml tags intended to add attributes.

Callback Example      ~

The following is an example of using XmlAttribCallback in your .vimrc
>
        function XmlAttribCallback (xml_tag)
            if a:xml_tag ==? "my-xml-tag"
                return "attributes=\"my xml attributes\""
            else
                return 0
            endif
        endfunction

The following is a sample html.vim file type plugin you could use:

  " Don't set 'b:did_ftplugin = 1' because that is xml.vim's responsability.
