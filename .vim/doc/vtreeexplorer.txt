0. DESCRIPTION					*vtreeexplorer*

This plugin creates a tree based file explorer within vim.  The tree view is
similar to the output of the unix 'tree' command, with the addition that
directories are foldable and the tree is lazy loaded as you navigate the tree.
The tree is highlighted and several mapping are created for naviagation and
opening files from the tree.

==============================================================================
2. VTREEEXPLORER INSTALLATION			*vtreeexplorer-install*

To install, un-gzip and un-tar in your $HOME/.vim or $VIMRUNTIME directory, or
the equivalent for the OS you are using.  To add this documentation to the
searchable help index, do ":helptags ~/.vim/doc" or equivalent.

==============================================================================
3. VTREEEXPLORER CONFIGURATION			*vtreeexplorer-config*

There are four global variables that affect vtreeexplorer on startup.  These
variables only affect the initial behavior after using |VTreeExplore| or
|VSTreeExplore| to start the tree explorer.  Setting these variables after the
start of the tree explorer with those commands will have no affect on
currently running tree explorers.  Settings can be changed with the
commands/functions/mappings in running tree explorers.  This allows for the
creation of mutliple tree explorer windows with different settings.  The
global variables affecting tree explorer startup are:

treeExplVertical				*treeExplVertical*

Set this variable in your vimrc to use a vertical split when using the
splitting version of the explorer |VSTreeExplore|.

treeExplWinSize					*treeExplWinSize*

Set this variable to a number in your vimrc to control the windows size (width
or height, depending on |treeExplVertical| when using the splitting version of
the explorer |VSTreeExplore|.

treeExplHidden					*treeExplHidden*

Set this variable in your vimrc to start the exlorer with hidden files shown.
Otherwise, the explorer will be started with hidden files (start with '.' for
Unix) not shown.

This setting can be be toggled with the 'a' mapping (|vtreeexplorer-a|.

treeExplDirSort					*treeExplDirSort*

Set this variable in your vimrc to start the explorer with the desired
directory sorting. Possible values:

	 0 : no directory sorting
	 1 : directories sorted first
	-1 : directories sorted last

This setting can be switched with the 'D' mapping (|vtreeexplorer-D|.

==============================================================================
4. VTREEEXPLORER TERMS				*vtreeexplorer-terms*

The following terms are defined for brevity in the remainder of the
documentation:

cursordir					*vtreeexplorer-cursordir*

This term refers to the directory where the cursor is in the explorer.  If the
cursor is on a line with a directory, that is the cursordir.  If the cursor is
on a file, then the cursor dir is the parent directory of the file on the
cursor line.

topdir						*vtreeexplorer-topdir*

This term refers to the directory where the tree explorerer is rooted - that
is, the top-most directory shown in the tree.

==============================================================================
5. VTREEEXPLORER MAPPINGS			*vtreeexplorer-mappings*

'<enter>'					*vtreeexplorer-enter*

Same as |vtreeexplorer-o| below.

'o'						*vtreeexplorer-o*

If the cursor is on a line with a file, open that file in another window.  The
last window visitied is where the file will be opened, unless the previous
window contains an unmodified buffer or there is only one window, in which
case a new window will be opened for the file.

If the cursor is on a line with a directory, load the directory if it isn't
loaded, or toggle the fold for that directory, if the directory is loaded.

'X'						*vtreeexplorer-X*

Recursively expand the |vtreeexplorer-cursordir|.

'E'						*vtreeexplorer-E*

Open the standard vim |file-explorer| on the |vtreeexplorer-cursordir|.

'C'						*vtreeexplorer-C*

Change the |vtreeexplorer-topdir| to the |vtreeexplorer-cursordir|.

'H'						*vtreeexplorer-H*

Change the |vtreeexplorer-topdir| to your home directory, defined by the
environement variable $HOME.

'u'						*vtreeexplorer-u*

Change the |vtreeexplorer-topdir| up one level, to the parent directory of the
current topdir.

'p'						*vtreeexplorer-p*

Move the cursor to the parent directory of the |vtreeexplorer-cursordir|.
Hitting 'p' mutliple times will quickly take you to the top of the tree.

'r'						*vtreeexplorer-r*

Refresh the |vtreeexplorer-cursordir|.  This command might unload
subdirectories of the cursordir, depending on current expansion.

'R'						*vtreeexplorer-R*

Refresh the |vtreeexplorer-topdir|.This command might unload subdirectories of
the cursordir, depending on current expansion.

'S'						*vtreeexplorer-S*

Start a shell in the |vtreeexplorer-cursordir|.

'D'						*vtreeexplorer-D*

Switch between the three directory sorting modes, described at
|treeExplDirSort|.  Initial value can be set with global variable
|treeExplDirSort|.

'a'						*vtreeexplorer-a*

Toggle showing hidden files.  Initial value can be set with global variable
|treeExplHidden|.

'?'						*vtreeexplorer-?*

Toggle long help display at top of window.

==============================================================================
5. VTREEEXPLORER COMMANDS			*vtreeexplorer-commands*

:CD						*vtreeexplorer-CD*

Change |vtreeexplorer-topdir| to argument of command.
